- **api-gateway** - It's a gateway app runs on a port ```9191``` to route incoming requests to the appropriate destination using Gateway Handler Mapping configured in the xml file. It uses the app names from service registry to perform routing. Since above end points (```GET``` & ```PUT```)  are configured in this gateway therefore clients can consume them through gateway end points rather consuming them directly.
